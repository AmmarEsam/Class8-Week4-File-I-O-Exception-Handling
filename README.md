# Class8-Week4-File-I-O-Exception-Handling


## Letters for each line

Write a Python program to create a file where all letters of English alphabet(uppercase and lowercase both) are listed by specified number of letters on each line.

## Question 2

Write a Python program to generate 26 text files named A.txt, B.txt, and so on up to Z.txt.

## LCM

As a user, I want to use a program which can calculate the least common multiple (L.C.M.) of four numbers. So that I can find the least common multiple (L.C.M.) of my inputs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Ask user to enter the four numbers.
* Use try/except blocks to verify input entries and warn the user for Nan or non numerical inputs.
* Calculate the least common multiple (L.C.M.) of four numbers
* Use gcd function in module of math

## 4- Mis Calculator

As a user, I want to use a program which can calculate basic  mathematical operations. So that I can add, subtract, multiply or divide my inputs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* The calculator must support the Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and  Division operations.
* Define four functions in four files for each of them, with two float numbers as parameters.
* To calculate the answer, use math.ceil() Â and get the next integer value greater than the result
* Create a menu using the print command with the respective options and take an input choice from the user.
* Using if/elif statements for cases and call the appropriate functions.
* Use try/except blocks to verify input entries and warn the user for incorrect inputs.
* Ask user if calculate numbers again. To implement this, take the input from user `Y` or `N`.
